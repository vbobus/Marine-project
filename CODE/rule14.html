        <div class="facts">
            <p>The world’s oceans – their temperature, chemistry, currents and life – drive global systems that make the Earth habitable for humankind. How we manage this vital resource is essential for humanity as a whole, and to counterbalance the effects
                of climate change.
            </p>
            <p>Over three billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods. However, today we are seeing 30 percent of the world’s fish stocks overexploited, reaching below the level at which they can produce sustainable yields.</p>
            <p>Oceans also absorb about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide produced by humans, and we are seeing a 26 percent rise in ocean acidification since the beginning of the industrial revolution.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="conclusion">
            <p>The SDGs aim to sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems from pollution, as well as address the impacts of ocean acidification. Enhancing conservation and the sustainable use of ocean-based resources through international
                law will also help mitigate some of the challenges facing our oceans.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Find a Goal 14 charity you want to support. Any donation, big or small, can make a difference! </li>
                <li>Never buy bottled water – boil, filter, chlorine, rainwater, do what you can.</li>
                <li>Reduce waste - much of the waste that we produce on land ends up in the oceans. Stop using plastic bags: Usage and wrong disposal of plastic is a major cause of marine pollution.</li>
                <li>Run a campaign on the effects of plastic use on the seas and oceans.</li>
                <li>Organize a cleanup project for rivers and oceans. Engage your whole community to clean up a local river, seaside or an ocean.</li>
                <li>Buy local and certified fish. You can support small-scale producers by shopping in local markets and shops.</li>
